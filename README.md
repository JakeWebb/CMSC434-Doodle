This is my Doodle application for CMSC434 (Human Computer Interaction) at the University of Maryland. The application has a simple 
canvas taking up the majority of the screen. A toolbar can slide out from the left side of the screen. From this toolbar, sliders can 
be used to set the stroke width, transparency, and color. Indivdual sliders provide the ability to indpendently change the rgb values 
of the color. A small square is displayed with the new color. The user has the ability to undo and redo strokes as well as clear the canvas,
with the buttons available in the toolbar. The sliding drawer toolbar was made with the guide from this website:
